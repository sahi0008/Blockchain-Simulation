# Blockchain-Simulation
A simple blockchain simulation in Python demonstrating core concepts: block structure, SHA-256 hashing, proof-of-work mining, and chain validation. The simulation allows adding blocks, displays the chain, and detects tampering by verifying hash integrity. Includes a demo of tampering with a block to showcase how the chain identifies corruption.
